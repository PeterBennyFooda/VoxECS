# VoxECS
VoxECS is a voxel game engine designed with an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture, enabling efficient and modular management of complex voxel-based worlds (work in progress).

## Technical Details

### Simple Terrain Generation
Employed 2D and 3D Perlin noise to generate smooth, natural terrains, and utilized Poisson Disc Sampling for tree placement.

### Chunk Management
Combined voxels into chunks mesh and culled unseen faces to optimize the meshing process.  
I plan to implement greedy meshing to further reduce the number of vertices.

### Character Controls
Enabled player movement using both mouse and keyboard, along with block placement and removal functionality.

### Ambient Occlusion
Calculated ambient occlusion for each vertex using information solely from adjacent cubes, rather than relying on post-processing.
